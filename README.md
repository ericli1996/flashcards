## Technologies used

This project uses vanilla Javascript, Chai, and Mocha. This project is an exercise in Test Driven Development (TDD).

## Instructions

1. From the command line in terminal, run node index.js.

2. A message showing that the game has started and the number of the cards in the deck should show.

3. A user can either scroll and hit enter, or input the number of their desired guess and hit enter to make a guess.

4. The application will return feedback if the guess was correct or not, and move onto the next card.

5. When there are no more cards left to play, the application returns the total correctly guessed percentage.
